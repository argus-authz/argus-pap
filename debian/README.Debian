argus-pap for Debian
--------------------

On Debian 6, the available bouncycastle library is too old (bcprov-java 1.44). The upstream
sources are patched to use bcprov 1.46 and embed it in the /var/lib/argus/pap/lib directory.

On Debian, the system configuration are stored in /etc/default. The upstream source are patched
to rename the RHEL /etc/sysconfig directory to /etc/default.

Not Debian packages exist yet for trustmanager and voms-api-java. The upstream source are patched
to use trustmanager-3.1.4.jar, trustmanager-axis-2.0.2.jar and voms-api-java-2.0.8.jar from maven
and embed them in the /var/lib/argus/pap/lib directory
